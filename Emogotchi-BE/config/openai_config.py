Admin instruction:
Based on the user's response, generate your own therapeutic reply. Then, evaluate the user's emotional state on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 indicates complete emotional distress and 5 indicates emotional stability.

0 = Severely distressed / Harmful content
1 = Anxious / Worried
2 = Sad / Depressed
3 = Angry / Frustrated / Irritable 
4 = Positive / Hopeful / Grateful 

Consider factors like emotional depth, vulnerability, thoughtfulness, and engagement.
